[THE ACID ASPECT: PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AND COUNTERCULTURE IN THE SIXTIES


ALEXANDER MACDOUGALL


________________________________________

‘The Acid Aspect’ is an exploration of psychedelic drug use as exemplifying a significant focal point of sixties counterculture. Psychedelic drug use vivified countercultural ideals, inspired a reanalysis of contemporary American idealism, formed a reimagining of religious beliefs, and fundamentally altered popular music of the decade. To achieve these conclusions, this paper is divided into four major analyses that focus on: contemporary attitudes and opinions, ‘psychedelic-Americanism,’ psychedelic influences on Western theology, and the effects of psychedelics on popular music as codifying the experience of sixties counterculture.

________________________________________

Whether by the esoteric prophesizing of the Delphic oracles or the incoherent ramblings of a tipsy patron outside The Roxy, intoxication has proven itself to be a mainstay of civilizations throughout history. During the 1960’s, psychedelic drug use became synonymous with counterculture’s flagship stereotype: the hippie. The use of hallucinatory drugs meant laziness, apathy, and a misunderstanding or rejection of contemporary Western society in the eyes of many. Alternatively, sixties counterculture largely embraced psychedelics as a vessel for protest, spiritual liberation, and political freedom. Psychedelic drugs became a significant focal point within sixties counterculture, vivifying countercultural ideologies, inspiring a reanalysis of contemporary American idealism, a reimagining of religious beliefs, and fundamentally altering popular music of the late sixties. Four analyses will be made to support the theory that psychedelics were critical to several aspects of counterculture. First, the attitudes of preceding generations, counterculture’s more militant elements, and proponents of psychedelia will be explored. Then, parallels drawn between historical American idealism and hallucinogenic drug use will be examined. Furthermore, the reimagining of Western religion as inspired by psychedelia and Eastern theologies (a blanket term popularly used amongst authors of countercultural literature that typically refers to specific or amalgamated Taoist, Buddhist, and Hindu beliefs) will be assessed. Finally, an exploration of psychedelic drug use and its effects on popular music will conclude this paper, demonstrating a sonic aspect to counterculture and deduced via an analysis of Jimi Hendrix. This essay will illuminate the significance of psychedelia within counterculture, explaining how it was both central and complementary to political, spiritual, and artistic movements.
 
For many within the broad counterculture of the 1960’s, psychedelic drug use entailed its own form of protest, enhancing contemporary social theories. While discussing the use of LSD by members of the Weathermen, a militant offshoot of the University of Michigan activist organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), journalists Bruce Shlain and Martin Lee claimed, “LSD does not make people more or less political… it reinforces and magnifies what’s already in their heads.”   It stands to reason that this logic may apply to sixties counterculture overall.  The rejection of constraining fifties culture had perhaps become more vivid to those who ingested hallucinogenic drugs. As Shlain and Lee suggested regarding the Weathermen, members of the Black Panthers supposed drugs like LSD, marijuana, and mescaline to be “instrumental in developing the revolutionary consciousness of the people.”  Notions of psychedelia inspiring a revolutionary mentality must have certainly drawn ire from America’s more conformational segments of society, especially racist whites standing in opposition to the Black Panthers. Such resistance would only give further justification for their use by those associated with counterculture.
 
The idea that psychedelics reinforced the counterculture of the sixties may also be found in its denunciation by generations preceding the baby boomers, “proving to the counterculture that dope use must be ethical.”  For sixties youth, the use of drugs was its own form of protesting the plainly visible moral faults of contemporary American society. Largely perceived as complacent in institutional racism, global conflict, and the continuation of strictly defined gender roles, youth of the era held a dim view of their parent’s generation. Shifting attitudes toward psychedelic drugs by early promoters of their use may have also enflamed the counterculture’s drive for alternative notions of society and reality. While testifying before a congressional committee on the topic of psychedelic legality, Sidney Cohen, who conducted initially positive clinical research on LSD in 1960 but later redacted his pro-psychedelic position in 1962 over his concerns with non-medicinal

use and patient harm,  described an issue “more alarming than death in a way… the loss of all cultural values… these people [hippies]… lead a valueless life… they are decultured, lost to society, lost to themselves.”  Despite a tone of marked negativity towards counterculture, Cohen’s diatribe paradoxically explains the root of counterculture: that intense scrutiny or outright rejection of contemporary values, culture, and society were central to radical change. Counterculture’s embracing of psychedelia in the face of growing resistance, from prior generations and prior proponents alike, would ultimately form a libertarian-esque political movement that emphasized American idealism.
 
Featuring “pronounced ideological overtones,”  psychedelic-Americanism can be found in both the reactions of counterculture towards the dawning illegality of their use, and in the hallucinations of those experiencing a ‘trip.’ Parapsychologist Stanley Krippner described his first psilocybin experience as a journey throughout the geographic and temporal New World, interacting with figures like Thomas Jefferson, Edgar Allan Poe, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy.  While writer Chris Elcock tentatively ascribed Krippner’s experience to derive from “national myths… firmly rooted in the American psyche,”  the parapsychologist’s experience was perhaps forged out of a subconscious reimagining of contemporary political events; namely, the assassination of J.F.K. This interpretation stands in line with prior assertions of psychedelics as magnifiers or reinforcers of what is already known to the user.  Whatever the true psychological origin of Krippner’s experience was, his profoundly American hallucination purports a degree of Americanism within the contemporary psychedelic experience.

While proponents such as Timothy Leary “became the symbol[s]… of separation from so-called American values,”  hippie counterculture and Western individualism overlapped in some ways. One such overlap is found in the paralleling of the cowboy and hippie archetypes. Paradoxically, hippies would embrace aspects of the Western gunslinger. While the cowboy might represent “imperialism, cultural genocide, and other unsavory aspects of westward expansion”  in American History, hippies drew on the mythological cowboy to

highlight counterculture’s fundamentally Americanist foundation. Both characterizations emphasized freedom, self-sufficiency, and the expansion of American society into a new realm. Hippie culture also found common ground with the cowboy by sharing a “near-Jeffersonian vision of an agrarian republic,”  reflected by the numerous countercultural communes that sprouted up throughout United States in the sixties and seventies. One such commune, The Farm, now located in tiny Summertown, Tennessee, was formed around the lofty principles of love, altruism, and communalism, and, as the commune’s founders perceived, cities were incapable of maintaining spaces suitable for these values.  It is not too outlandish to perceive some similarities between this drive to escape the seemingly indifferent social principles of the city and the Thirteen Colonies’ own will to escape the restrictive hand of London. Just as the burgeoning American republic sought the acquisition of rich farmland west of the Appalachians, so to did the hippie seek the acquisition of an agrarian space that could satiate her appetite, literally and spiritually.

Aside from comparable historical stereotypes, legal arguments in favor of psychedelics were made during the 1960’s that harkened to the United State’s founding principles. Art Kleps employed a reimagining of American History to furnish legal arguments in support of the use of mind-altering drugs in a religious setting. In 1966, Kleps would testify to the United States Senate about rising psychedelic drug use by college students, largely supporting this trend himself. Kleps would describe imagery of the Revolutionary War before the Senate, declaring hopeful wishes for a “return to that fierce defense of human rights, to that spirit of freedom and tolerance under which [the United States] was founded.”  Kleps’ notions of early American ‘freedom’ and ‘tolerance’ are certainly exaggerations of America’s true social circumstances following the Revolutionary War’s conclusion. Despite this, his reference to a nationally defining moment in American History gives credence to a counterculture ideology that stems from the comparison of historical American ideals to those of contemporary events.
 
Symbolic imagery of cowboys and continental marines was not the only reimaging of American society undertaken by psychedelic counterculture, as a certain zealot of psychedelia presented the framework for a mind-altering religion. Purporting “new answers to the ultimate secrets of the universe,”  Timothy Leary would become adored by his devotees in much the way Jesus, Mohammad or Gotama were revered by their early disciples.  Religious allusions within Leary’s psychedelic

doctrine can be found throughout his Politics of Ecstasy. While the analysis of psychological studies purporting ‘religious’ experiences while intoxicated by psychedelics  may speak directly to notions of spiritual-psychedelia, Leary’s “seven basic spiritual questions”  highlights his counter-Christian approach. When compared to the Bible’s Ten Commandments, Leary’s seven questions appear diametrically opposed to Christian scripture. Whereas The Ten Commandments declare absolute truth and simple guidelines about how to approach God and social existence, the seven spiritual questions offer no answers. Leary can thus be seen to eschew the traditions of conformity and immaterial assurances that were typically associated with twentieth century Christianity and turn instead to provocative thinking and inward spiritual exploration. Each question hints at answers that may be found within separate disciplines of science, “continually being answered and answered,”  akin to Eastern tenets of reincarnation.
 
A focus on Eastern mysticism can be found throughout much of hippie counterculture. Writer Aldous Huxley proposed that his first use of mescaline had propelled him “directly into the realms of Eastern enlightenment,”  far from Christian theology’s monotheism.  Huxley’s intermingling of Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christian theologies, expressed throughout his The Perennial Philosophy, likely helped magnify his psychedelic experience’s mystical nature. Alternatively, LSD inventor Albert Hofmann stated that his experience with LSD “illuminated the very words of Jesus recorded in John 14:20… I am in my Father, and yet in me, and I in you.”  While LSD offered Hofmann greater insight into his Christian beliefs, it also pushed him to scrutinize the church as an institution.  Though perhaps not an explicit proponent of counterculture in the same vein as Timothy Leary, Hofmann’s personal revolution against church-led Christianity speaks to the ability of drugs like LSD to inspire a rejection or intense scrutiny of well-established institutions. Much like the cowboy, the church represented a fundamental ethos that the counterculture could agree upon. Rather than seek to destroy such institutions, the counterculture simply upended what was deemed incorrect or perverted with psychedelically inspired Eastern revisionism and Christian reanalysis. 
Concurrent to psychedelically inspired spiritual reassessment was the embracing of psychedelically inspired music. Although early sixties folk music would inspire

many social messages associated with the 1967 Summer of Love,  the advent of psychedelic rock (psyche-rock or progressive rock) did not occur until later in the sixties, concurrent with the increasing popularity of psychedelics.  One has only to look at the progressively vivid and extravagant album covers of bands like The Rolling Stones or The Beatles to note an escalating marketability of psychedelic imagery and audio as the decade progressed. The popularity surrounding this combination of hallucinogens and music may have been aided by the dawn of televised performances and world tours by the likes of Elvis or – again – The Beatles. Television brought concerts into households across the United States and larger concerts, that now had global reach thanks to commercial air travel, demanded a greater volume of sound. Essentially, music had become more widely marketable and visceral in its presentation, undergoing its own technologically induced transformation. Pushed to its psychedelic extreme by acts such as Pink Floyd, “the worldwide trend toward concerts as perception-altering experiences had begun.”  Following concurrent advancements in television, amplification, and affordable air travel, the use of psychedelic drugs turned the concert dial to eleven.
 
As one prime example of contemporary visual and auditory experience, Jimi Hendrix highlights the dawn of electrified psychedelia. While bands such as The Beatles or Rolling Stones may have simply shifted their artistic stylings to suit ongoing social change, Jimi Hendrix stands out as an artist whose dress, sound, and lyrical content fully represents the sixties psychedelic and countercultural stereotypes from beginning to end. Writer Sheila Whiteley’s exploration of Hendrix’s overtly psychedelic song “Purple Haze” notes prevailing psychedelia not just in the song’s lyrical content, but in the sonic composition of the song as well. In her own words, “the sheer volume of noise works towards the drowning of personal consciousness…the guitar…tripping around the basic notes.”  In many ways, the imperfect tripping of notes or unbearably loud volume of Purple Haze plays into a concept of anti-music, with a focus on dissonance and noise rather than harmony and tempered dynamics. Hendrix’s take on “The Star-Spangled Banner” may be his most clairvoyant deconstruction of American culture, pervading the national anthem with a series of electrified eruptions that some might equate to noise rather than music. Even his decision to play a right-handed guitar upside down rather than purchase a left-handed guitar might reinforce notions of “turning

upside down the conventional world.”  Sonically inspired by psychedelia, Jimi Hendrix would embrace a reimagining of what constituted music, reflecting contemporary counterculture’s broader reimagining of society and culture. Although musical genres of the twentieth century evolved nearly per-decade, none of these evolutions were influenced so markedly by drugs and anti-establishment ideology. The influence of psychedelia on counterculture had been permanently etched into the less tangible language of music.
 
Popularized by youth resistance, psycho-gurus, and revolutionary music, psychedelics played a critical role in sixties counterculture. Stringent opposition by generations preceding the baby boomers added the allure of rebellion to their use, while their pronounced introspective effects made existing countercultural opinions stronger. These opinions were further compounded through the reimagining of Western spiritualism by thinkers such as Timothy Leary and Albert Hofmann, who scrutinized Christianity while instigating a marriage between psychedelia and Eastern theologies. The visual and auditory culmination of psychedelically influenced counterculture is then broadly apparent in the late sixties’ popularization of psychedelic rock, whose leading artist was arguably Jimi Hendrix. Based on my personal experience, psychedelic drug use can be conducive of intense inner reflection and environmental examination. With a deep re-examination of American society during the sixties, the self-reflective effects of psychedelic drugs coincided almost perfectly with the ere of radical change sought by counterculture. Psychedelic drugs and the sixties counterculture proved to be an historical match made in heaven, whose anthem was choired by psychonautic angels adorned with electric guitars.
